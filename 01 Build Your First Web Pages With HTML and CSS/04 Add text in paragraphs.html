<h1>Polar bear</h1>

<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>

<p>The <strong>polar bear</strong> <em>(Ursus maritimus)</em> is a carnivorous bear whose native range lies largely
    within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle">Arctic Circle</a>,
    encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is a large bear, approximately
    the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi).[3] A boar (adult male) weighs around
    350–700 kg (772–1,543 lb),[4] while a sow (adult female) is about half that size. Although it is the sister species
    of the brown bear,[5] it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecolowhitpgical niche, with many body characteristics
    adapted
    for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its
    diet.[6] Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_ice">sea ice</a>. Their scientific
    name means "maritime bear" and derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge
    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_ice">sea ice</a>, often living off fat reserves when no <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_ice">sea ice</a> is present. Because of their dependence on the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_ice">sea ice</a>,
    polar bears are classified as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal">sea ice</a>.[7]</p>

<p>Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate change, the <strong>polar bear</strong> is classified as a
    vulnerable species, and
    at least three of the nineteen <strong>polar bear</strong> subpopulations are currently in decline.[8] However, at
    least two of the
    nineteen subpopulations are currently increasing, while another six are considered stable.[9] For decades,
    large-scale hunting raised international concern for the future of the species, but populations rebounded after
    controls and quotas began to take effect.[10] For thousands of years, the <strong>polar bear</strong> has been a key
    figure in the
    material, spiritual, and cultural life of circumpolar peoples, and polar bears remain important in their cultures.
    Historically, the <strong>polar bear</strong> has also been known as the <strong>white bear</strong>.[11]</p>

<h2>Naming and etymology</h2>

<p>Constantine John Phipps was the first to describe the <strong>polar bear</strong> as a distinct species in 1774.[1]
    He chose the
    scientific name Ursus maritimus, the Latin for 'maritime bear',[12] due to the animal's native habitat. The Inuit
    refer to the animal as nanook (transliterated as nanuq in the Inupiat language).[13][14] The Yupik also refer to the
    bear as nanuuk in Siberian Yupik.[15] The bear is umka in the Chukchi language. In Russian, it is usually called
    бе́лый медве́дь (bélyj medvédj, the <strong>White bear</strong>), though an older word still in use is ошку́й
    (Oshkúj, which comes
    from the Komi oski, "bear").[16] In Quebec, the <strong>polar bear</strong> is referred to as ours blanc
    (<strong>"white bear"</strong>) or ours
    polaire ("<strong>polar bear</strong>").[17] In the Norwegian-administered Svalbard archipelago, the <strong>polar
        bear</strong> is referred to as
    Isbjørn ("ice bear").</p>

<p>The <strong>polar bear</strong> was previously considered to be in its own genus, Thalarctos.[18] However, evidence
    of hybrids between
    polar bears and brown bears, and of the recent evolutionary divergence of the two species, does not support the
    establishment of this separate genus, and the accepted scientific name is now therefore Ursus maritimus, as Phipps
    originally proposed.[1]</p>
